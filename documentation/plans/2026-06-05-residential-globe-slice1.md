# Slice 1 — Residential Globe Walking Skeleton (design)

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Status:** Draft for Andy's review. No feature code until approved.
**Scope authority:** `memory/decision_step7_slice_phasing_2026-06-05.md` (phasing) + `documentation/feature_residential_globe_onboarding.md` v1.1 (canonical UX, amended by the phasing decision).
**Goal:** Prove the residential-capture loop end-to-end and get Andy's own residential history onto the globe. Everything else is later slices.

---

## 1. Scope

**In:** a globe surface with a Find Location search box; place search flies the camera to the area; the user zooms and drags a pin to the precise spot; a modal captures free-form text + an optional date/range; saving writes the full data chain; pins re-render with solid sequential arcs and persist across reloads.

**Out (later slices):** images, pin-click detail card, AI extraction, sidekick chat, side-trip/vacation/professional place types, drag-to-refine after save, insert-before/after, delete, clustering, intra-metro detection, threshold events, mobile, Timeline.

**Place type in Slice 1:** Main Residence only (`relationship_type='lived_at'`).

## 2. Prep dependencies (must be true before build runs)

- Migration 1 applied → `capture_mode` CHECK accepts `globe_onboarding`. (Relationship-type rows it adds aren't used until Slice 3, but the migration is applied whole.)
- Migration 2 applied → `authored_by_actor` column present (Slice-1 inserts set it to `'owner'`).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` in `.env.local`.
- `mapbox-gl` installed (+ the search component chosen in §5).

## 3. Route & surface

New protected route `app/(protected)/globe/page.tsx` (server component → auth guard via existing layout) mounting a client `<Globe>` component. Not wired into primary nav yet — reachable directly during alpha. (The Globe-as-first-screen nav change is part of the navigation-surfaces work, not Slice 1.)

## 4. Components

- `components/globe/GlobeView.tsx` (client) — owns the Mapbox map instance (`projection: 'globe'`), renders existing pins + arcs, handles the place-search → fly-to, draggable draft pin, and "place here" confirmation that opens the modal.
- `components/globe/FindLocationBox.tsx` — the forward-geocode search input.
- `components/globe/PinModal.tsx` — free-form textarea (rotating ghost text per spec §6.1) + optional date/range text field + Save / Cancel.
- `lib/globe/geocoding.ts` — thin wrappers over Mapbox forward + reverse geocoding; maps a result's feature type → `place_subtype` (more robust than camera-zoom inference; see §7).
- `app/api/globe/residence/route.ts` — `POST` that performs the persistence chain in §6 in one server-side transaction-like sequence; `GET` returning the user's pins + sequence for initial render.

## 5. Geocoding & map library decision

`mapbox-gl` for the map. For search, recommend **Mapbox Search JS** (`@mapbox/search-js-react`) for the Find Location box — purpose-built, accessible, handles session tokens/billing correctly. Reverse geocoding on pin-drop uses the Geocoding API directly via `lib/globe/geocoding.ts`. Alternative considered: `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-geocoder` (older, heavier styling baggage) — rejected.

## 6. Data flow on Save (the loop)

Server route does, in order, rolling back on failure:
1. Resolve/insert the geographic hierarchy from the reverse-geocode result: upsert `entities` rows for country → region → city → (neighbourhood/address) with `parent_id` chain; the leaf place entity gets `type='place'`, `place_subtype`, `geom` (PostGIS point from drag lat/lng).
2. Insert `relationships`: `subject_user_id = user`, `object_id = leaf place entity`, `relationship_type='lived_at'`, `sort_order = max(existing)+1`, dates if provided, `authored_by_actor='owner'`.
3. Insert `memories`: `content_raw` = verbatim modal text, `capture_mode='globe_onboarding'`, `source='text_entry'`, `authored_by_actor='owner'`.
4. Insert `memory_entities`: memory → leaf place entity, `role='location'`, `is_primary=true`.
5. (Deferred to Slice 2: emit the extraction Inngest event. Slice 1 does **not** emit, to keep the loop synchronous and inspectable.)

`generate_residency_constraints()` fires automatically on the `lived_at` insert (existing schema trigger) — no app code needed; we verify it produced constraint rows.

## 7. Precision / place_subtype

Drive `place_subtype` from the **reverse-geocode result's feature type** (`country`/`region`/`place`/`neighborhood`/`address`), not camera zoom — robust to users zooming for visibility rather than precision (revises spec §5.4). Store the drag lat/lng as `geom` regardless.

## 8. Persistence & re-render

On load, `GET /api/globe/residence` returns pins ordered by `sort_order` with lat/lng + name. `GlobeView` renders a marker per pin and a solid line layer connecting them in sequence. Reload shows the same globe.

## 9. Testing / verification (alpha-appropriate)

Per Andy's standing override, not strict TDD for the local alpha — but every slice ships with verification:
- A `scripts/verify-globe-slice1.mjs` that drives the persistence route with a sample place and asserts the four rows + the constraint row exist, then cleans up (pattern matches existing `scripts/verify-*.mjs`).
- Manual: place 3–4 real pins (Andy's own early residences), reload, confirm persistence + arcs.
- Type-check + build must pass before commit.

## 10. Open micro-decisions for Andy

1. **Date field format** — single free-text "when" field (parsed later), or two fields (from / to)? Recommend single free-text for Slice 1 (matches spec §3.2; structured parsing is Slice 2 extraction).
2. **Route name** — `/globe` good? (vs `/onboarding`, `/residences`.)
3. **Mapbox Search JS** vs plain Geocoding-API-backed custom box — confirm the dependency add.

## 11. Reminder

The §1 "Out" list is hard scope — do not build any of it in Slice 1, even if it's quick. Each belongs to a named later slice.
